The development of the model of the atom,"New experimental evidence may lead to a scientific model being changed or replaced. Before the discovery of the electron, atoms were thought to be tiny spheres that could not be divided. The discovery of the electron led to the plum pudding model of the atom. The plum pudding model suggested that the atom is a ball of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.\n

The results from the alpha particle scattering experiment led to the conclusion that the mass of an atom was concentrated at the centre (nucleus) and that the nucleus was charged. This nuclear model replaced the plum pudding model. Niels Bohr adapted the nuclear model by suggesting that electrons orbit the nucleus at specific distances.\n

The theoretical calculations of Bohr agreed with experimental observations. Later experiments led to the idea that the positive charge of any nucleus could be subdivided into a whole number of smaller particles, each particle having the same amount of positive charge.\n The name proton was given to these particles. The experimental work of James Chadwick provided the evidence to show the existence of neutrons within the nucleus. This was about 20 years after the nucleus became an accepted scientific idea.\n

When people walk, run or travel in a car their speed is constantly changing. The speed at which a person can walk, run or cycle depends on many factors including: age, terrain, fitness and distance travelled.\n

Typical values may be taken as: walking ̴ 1.5 m/s running ̴ 3 m/s cycling ̴ 6 m/s. Students should be able to recall typical values of speed for a person walking, running and cycling as well as the typical values of speed for different types of transportation systems.\n

 It is not only moving objects that have varying speed. The speed of sound and the speed of the wind also vary. A typical value for the speed of sound in air is 330 m/s.\n

Students should be able to make measurements of distance and time and then calculate speeds of objects.\n

For an object moving at constant speed the distance travelled in a specific time can be calculated using the equation:\n

distance travelled = speed × time\n

Visible light,"Each colour within the visible light spectrum has its own narrow band of wavelength and frequency. Reflection from a smooth surface in a single direction is called specular reflection. Reflection from a rough surface causes scattering: this is called diffuse reflection. Colour filters work by absorbing certain wavelengths (and colour) and transmitting other wavelengths (and colour).\n

The colour of an opaque object is determined by which wavelengths of light are more strongly reflected. Wavelengths that are not reflected are absorbed. If all wavelengths are reflected equally the object appears white. If all wavelengths are absorbed the objects appears black. Objects that transmit light are either transparent or translucent.\n 

Students should be able to explain: \n
• how the colour of an object is related to the differential absorption, transmission and reflection of different wavelengths of light by the object

Poles of a magnet,"The poles of a magnet are the places where the magnetic forces are strongest. When two magnets are brought close together they exert a force on each other.

The field is strongest at the poles of the magnet.\n

The direction of the magnetic field at any point is given by the direction of the force that would act on another north pole placed at that point. The direction of a magnetic field line is from the north (seeking) pole of a magnet to the south(seeking) pole of the magnet. \n
