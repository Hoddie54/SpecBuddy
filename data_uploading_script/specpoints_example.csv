Energy stores and systems,"A system is an object or group of objects.
 There are changes in the way energy is stored when a system
 changes.
 Students should be able to describe all the changes involved in the
 way energy is stored when a system changes, for common
 situations. For example:",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcfxty39Cw,https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/physics/aqa/17/revision-notes/8-nuclear-physics/8-2-radioactive-decay/8-2-1-radioactive-decay/,1,1,1,FALSE
Changes in energy,"Students should be able to calculate the amount of energy
 associated with a moving object, a stretched spring and an object
 raised above ground level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcfxty39Cw,https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/physics/aqa/17/revision-notes/8-nuclear-physics/8-2-radioactive-decay/8-2-1-radioactive-decay/,1,1,2,FALSE
Energy changes in systems,"The amount of energy stored in or released from a system as its
 temperature changes can be calculated using the equation:
 change in thermal energy = mass × s peci f ic heat ca pacity
 × tem perature change",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcfxty39Cw,https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/physics/aqa/17/revision-notes/8-nuclear-physics/8-2-radioactive-decay/8-2-1-radioactive-decay/,1,1,3,FALSE
Energy transfers in a system,"Energy can be transferred usefully, stored or dissipated, but cannot
 be created or destroyed.
 Students should be able to describe with examples where there are
 energy transfers in a closed system, that there is no net change to
 the total energy.
 Students should be able to describe, with examples, how in all
 system changes energy is dissipated, so that it is stored in less
 useful ways. This energy is often described as being ‘wasted’.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcfxty39Cw,https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/physics/aqa/17/revision-notes/8-nuclear-physics/8-2-radioactive-decay/8-2-1-radioactive-decay/,1,2,1,FALSE
Efficiency,"The energy efficiency for any energy transfer can be calculated
 using the equation:
 e f f iciency = use f ul out put energy trans f er
 total in put energy trans f er
 Efficiency may also be calculated using the equation:
 e f f iciency = use f ul power out put
 total power in put",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcfxty39Cw,https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/physics/aqa/17/revision-notes/8-nuclear-physics/8-2-radioactive-decay/8-2-1-radioactive-decay/,1,2,2,FALSE
Increase efficiency,(HT only) Students should be able to describe ways to increase the efficiency of an intended energy transfer.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcfxty39Cw,https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/physics/aqa/17/revision-notes/8-nuclear-physics/8-2-radioactive-decay/8-2-1-radioactive-decay/,1,2,3,TRUE
